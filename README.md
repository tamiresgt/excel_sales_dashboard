## Data Preparation

The original database was in a format similar to a txt file, so the following processing steps had to be carried out. 

1. Find the delimiter and separate the text into columns.
2. Dates: change numerical formatting to date and separate month and year columns.
3. Customers' names: Separate into First name and Last name columns.
4. Price: change formatting to real currency.

## Analysis
The data analysis aimed to answer the following questions:

1. How is the sales performance of each salesperson?
2. Is the company achieving its sales target over the months and year? 
3. How is each course performing over the months and year-to-date? 
4. Which salesperson achieved the highest sales during the year?
5. How does each salesperson perform across different course offerings?
   
## Key Findings

The result of this project was a dashboard with interactive filters that led to the following insights:

1. **Sales Performance by Salesperson:** Overall, sales representatives have been achieving strong results over the years. However, a strategic action plan is required for salesperson JoÃ£o, who has been underperforming in Power BI and VBA sales. Analyzing JoÃ£oâ€™s successful strategies as the top salesperson in 2021 may provide insights to enhance his performance across all courses.

2. **Sales Target Achievement:** The company has shown consistent improvement in reaching sales targets, with results surpassing expectations. Given this trend, an increase in sales targets should be considered. However, August remains a challenge, requiring further investigation into factors affecting sales performance during this period.

3. **Course Performance:** The PowerPoint and Word courses have been underperforming compared to other offerings. To address this, new strategies should be implemented, including course content enhancements. Incorporating AI-driven tools to assist with presentations and text creation could attract more learners and improve course engagement.

This project demonstrates how Excelâ€™s powerful Pivot Tables and data preparation techniques can be used to build insightful dashboards for sales analysis. Feel free to contribute or ask questions! ðŸš€

This dashboard was built during the PowerBI course at HashtagTreinamentos.
