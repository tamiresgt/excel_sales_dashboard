# Excel Sales Dashboard for Technology Courses

## Project Overview

This project showcases an interactive sales dashboard built in Excel using Pivot Tables. The dashboard provides insights into the sales performance of various technology courses, allowing users to analyze revenue trends, seller performance, and sales distribution across different time periods.

## Key Features

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Insights:

Target vs. Revenue Analysis: Monthly revenue comparison against sales targets.

Revenue by Course: Breakdown of revenue per course (Excel, Power BI, Python, Word, PowerPoint, Tableau).

Top Performing Sellers: Identifies the seller with the highest sales during the year.

Revenue by Seller and Product: Analyzes which sellers contributed most to the revenue.

Year and Month Filters: Allows users to filter sales data by year and month for detailed analysis.

ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning and Preparation

To ensure the dataset was well-structured for analysis, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

Date Transformation: Extracted month and year from the date column for easier filtering.

Client Name Separation: Split full names into separate First Name and Surname columns.

Price Formatting: Adjusted price values to ensure they are recognized as currency.

Null Data Handling: Removed or replaced missing values to maintain data integrity.

This project demonstrates how Excelâ€™s powerful Pivot Tables and data cleaning techniques can be used to build insightful dashboards for sales analysis. Feel free to contribute or ask questions! ðŸš€
